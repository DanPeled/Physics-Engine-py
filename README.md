# Py Physics Engine

<div class="result-streaming markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert dark"><p>I apologize for the confusion. Here is an updated README for the physics engine:</p><h1>Physics Engine</h1><p>This is a physics engine designed to simulate the movement of balls in a 2D space. It uses the Python Turtle library to create a visual representation of the balls and their movement.</p><h2>Features</h2><ul><li>Allows customization of the ground height, screen width, screen height, and maximum height a ball can reach</li><li>Simulates the effects of gravity on the movement of the balls</li><li>Detects collisions between balls and the ground, reflecting their velocities accordingly</li><li>Detects collisions between balls, reflecting their velocities accordingly</li></ul><h2>Usage</h2><p>To use the physics engine, import the required libraries and create a ground and ball object. You can customize the parameters of the ground and ball objects as needed. Then, in a loop, call the <code>move</code> method of each ball object to update its position based on the laws of physics.</p><p>Example usage:</p><pre><div class="bg-black mb-4 rounded-md"><div class="flex items-center relative text-gray-200 bg-gray-800 px-4 py-2 text-xs font-sans"><span class="">ruby</span><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4"
